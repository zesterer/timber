# Timber

I got bored one afternoon and started writing a desktop panel

### What is Timber?

Timber is a Gtk 3 desktop panel. It draws inspiration from Wingpanel and Budgie-panel among others, yet will come to 
include several niche features seen in neither. I don't really recommend you use this as your everyday panel, it's more 
of a personal project.

### Compiling & Running

Easy as chips.

Building the thing:

`make build`

Running the thing:

`make run`

### Credits

I've learned from a lot of code whilst making this. Most notably Ikey Doherty of the Evolve OS project, and the one who 
developed Wingpanel, whoever you are. Thanks, I couldn't have even started this project without you.
