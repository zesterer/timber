# Timber

I got bored one afternoon and started writing a desktop panel

### What is Timber?

Timber is a Gtk 3 desktop panel. It draws inspiration from Wingpanel and Budgie-panel among others, yet will come to 
include several niche features seen in neither. I don't really recommend you use this as your everyday panel, it's more 
of a personal project.

### Compiling & Running
#### (Easy as chips)

Clone the repository:

`git clone git://www.github.com/zesterer/timber/`

Navigate to Timbers directory:

`cd timber`

Build Timber:

`make build`

Run Timber:

`make run`

### Credits

I've learned from a lot of code whilst making this. Most notably Ikey Doherty of the Evolve OS project, and the one who 
developed Wingpanel, whoever you are. Thanks, I couldn't have even started this project without you.
